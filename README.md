# Iris Classification ML Project

This project implements a simple Flask web application for classifying Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions. The application uses a Random Forest classifier trained on the famous Iris dataset.

## Features

- Allows users to input sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width via a web form.
- Provides real-time classification of Iris species based on user input.
- Displays the predicted species along with an image of the corresponding Iris flower.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MOHINI1403/iris-classifier.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd iris-classifier
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask server by running:

```bash
python deploy.py
```

2. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.
3. Enter the sepal and petal dimensions in the provided form fields and click "Classify".
4. View the predicted species along with an image of the corresponding Iris flower.
